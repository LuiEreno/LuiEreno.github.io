## The Problem 
Students proximity to fellow music lovers is hampered when they use online communities to communicate their love for certain artists/genres/songs. Although music gives us a connection to other people accross the globe, nothing beats listening to music with another person and enjoying the moment together. 

## The Solution
We want to create a community within the UH Manoa that would be tailored to listening to music together. Furthermore, if a student(s) is an artist or has band, they can promote themselves and therefore gain a following within their vicinity. We know that social media is a huge market, but our community is based off of just music. It's focused and tightly committed to creating an experience for students who want to voice their ideas/thoughts about certain music and if applicable incite a following. 

The way it would be done is to create a board that anybody could sign-up on and like/follow certain users. Similar to Reddit a user can create their own thread and can reply to. To refine exploration we would also create a search/filter function if a user wants to specify what they want to see. To make sure that the community focuses on UH Manoa and Hawaii we would restric account creation to UH students. Users can create their own porfolio that specifies their taste in music and if they want to create/join a band. 

## Mockup Page Ideas
The top menu will contain a navigation bar that will show the logo/title of the website, current thread (If applicable), upcoming music events (Talk about the upcoming events). A main body homepage that shows most recent threads, each thread will contain a title, poster name, upvote/downvote mechanic. We will use Mongodb to save users and their posts, React/Meteor will be used to implement the User Interfaces.
