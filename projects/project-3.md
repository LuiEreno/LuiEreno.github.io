The state of Hawaii passed a law that promises that the entire state will be 100% renewable energy powered by the year 2035. In this way, students at UH manoa wanted to get ahead of this endeavor by promoting student ideas through the designing of weatherboxes. Weatherboxes are meant to gather metoerological data that will eventaully get stored inside the labs database. 

The team I was in was named Team Guava, a 5th generation team. The main idea of the Guava board was to get to a point where all the components would be integrated within the PCB itself. In this way, we could mass produce much more easily because we don't have to accomodate headers, pin traces related to multiple devices and most importantly affordable cost.
