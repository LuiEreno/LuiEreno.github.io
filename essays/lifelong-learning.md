<img class="ui tiny right spaced image" src="../images/arch.jpeg">*Software Engineering*

Some may argue that software engineering is not real engineering, developers don't have to worry about stress testing supports, resist the thought creating triangles and physics - thankfully. Software engineers are people that can create things that the modern era have begun to stake their lives on. Monitoring, data scraping/analysis and of course entertainment. Most importantly they exhibit the fundamental virtue of engineering, which is how to properly problem solve. 

## "Let's Build an app together!"

If we were talking about what we want to learn within the context of this class, my immediate thought is creating a web app that I enjoy - then find a way to monetize it. I'm in an interesting position where I work as a web developer at a news media. Along with maintaing the site, we should also be thinking on how to engage the student population and leverage that interaction with the local businesss. In this way, we provide a service that no one else could replicate just by the virtue that we have an unhindered conenction with a profitable demographic. So, to further drive home my wants in this class - I want to be able to bridge the gap between creativity that affects people and creativity with a computer to produce something im proud of. 

## Lifelong Learning

Software engineering is touted as a job that will continously evolve - no set paradigm, library, language, framework will last long enough to warrant a stoppage in learning. Along with being able to have a hand within specific technologies, I want to cultivate skills and habits that would allow me digest these new techniques. One good way is to further deepen my understanding of my hobbies, one good advice that people will give to to fledgling programmers is to create something that you will use. If it relates to something I want to do, then its more likely that not only will I finish it but also go above and beyond.
