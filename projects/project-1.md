summary: My lab group was tasked, as a final project, to create a mini pipelined computer architecture that could fetch, decode and run instructions from a binary file.

EE361 - labeled as Digital design - was a class based around learning smaller components that make up slightly larger components that make up a computer. In this way, we were building up to two architectural paradigms which are: single cycle and pipeline. This class focused on the Legv8 instruction set, which is a subset of the Armv8. Our final project was to replicate both a single-cycle and pipelined Leg Lite architecture. 

Lite in this case refers to how the parts were designed to only work in 32 bit, components were working in their most rudimentary forms and the instruction set was restricted to a few of the common ones like add, subtract, conditional jumps and branches.
