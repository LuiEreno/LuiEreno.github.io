## Framed Work

I struggle mainly with creating my own creative/artistic ideas. If I was given a set of task to do with a bit of structure, that's where I would excel. As such, creating websites is difficult because using raw css and html is not very friendly towards people who don't know what looks good. The fact that Semantic UI have created a framework that allows me to not worry about creating my own structures, containers and sections means that in the grand scheme of creating a website - I would have one less thing to worry about. 

## Semantics Syntax

How Semantic works is that it allows designers to create modernized webpages by treating classes as exchangeable concepts. When an html element is defined as a text class then it gets interpreted as just a container that has text, whereas a container that was declared as a menu will act as a menu. Further refinements could be made through specifying the size of image/text/icon as small, medium, large etc. As such, the difficulty arises not from the usage but the ability for the designer/developer to recognize what component they are creating. This means the designer/developer must have a relatively large knowledge base with the documentation since a vast majority of modern webpages have components that semantic have already implemented. 

## The World isn't Ready

As a struggling uncreative developer, this not only strengthens my interest within the field but also gives me the necessary push to pursue page creation. Personally, I enjoy the syntax that it defined itself with. Although, I must remark that the learning curve was present. This is because coming from a c background where every function had to be understood and implemented by myself, it was jarring to find out that the classes were just something that you could just call. For now, I feel confident enough to put it on my resume as a beginner skill.
