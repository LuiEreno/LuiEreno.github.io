## Flexibility and Adaptability

My highschool's motto was "Enter to Learn, Go Forth to Serve" this sentiment seems so simple, but its important when its 
especially applied to the type of work that software engineers could get into. Even though it has heavy connotations with morality
and ethicality, I think it also easily applies to taking the generalized parts of software engineering into the real world. 
My software engineering class further developed the motto through managing the process of programming projects and learning
web frameworks.
