## An Uphill Battle

Being shackled to code in a certain way, to follow certain rules and adhere to strict regulations might seem like an arduous and menial task in the beginning. One already knows that documentation is important, but is formatting of said documentation really worth it. This annoyance travels further to writing code, seems superfluous to always add a space before the first curly brace of the function block. I thought documentation and formatting of said documentation was what the coding standards entailed, but little did I know that these were naive thoughts. Adding parenthesis' on the argument on an arrow function, space after the words if, while, for; horrendous. Or so I thought, I realized that the luxury that linting provides is to ensure that my eyes won't bleed when I have to look back at my spaghetti code. 

## Acceptance



## Understanding

Software engineering is touted as a job that will continously evolve - no set paradigm, library, language, and framework will last long enough to warrant a stoppage in learning. Along with having a hand within specific technologies, I want to cultivate skills and habits that would allow me digest these new techniques. One good way is to further deepen my understanding of my hobbies, one good advice that people will give to to fledgling programmers is to create something that you will use. If it relates to something I want to do, then its more likely that not only will I finish it but also go above and beyond. It's been made clear to me that software engineering will be kind to those who continue to learn and seek new things. Seeing as how my interests aren't focused yet, I chose to study Computer Engineering instead of continuing straight as a Computer Science student. I believe that my interaction with software is through a medium that doesn't uniformly conform to just computers.
