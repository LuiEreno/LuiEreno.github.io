## The Problem 
Students proximity to fellow music lovers is hampered when they use online communities to communicate their love for certain artists/genres/songs. Although music gives us a connection to other people accross the globe, nothing beats listening to music with another person and enjoying the moment together. 

## The Solution
We want to create a community within the UH Manoa that would be tailored to listening to music together. Furthermore, if a student(s) is an artist or has band, they can promote themselves and therefore gain a following within their vicinity. We know that social media is a huge market, but our community is based off of just music. It's focused and tightly committed to creating an experience for students who want to voice their ideas/thoughts about certain music and if applicable incite a following. 

The way it would be done is to create a board that anybody could sign-up on and like/follow certain users. Similar to Reddit a user can create their own thread and can reply to. To refine exploration we would also create a search/filter function if a user wants to specify what they want to see. To make sure that the community focuses on UH Manoa and Hawaii we would restric account creation to UH students.
