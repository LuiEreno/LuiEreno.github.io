For a student, finding spots to study can become a hassle when all their exposed to is whats in their path everyday. Even moreso when the path/routine that they have doesn't have any spots at all or the spot is always busy. Some ways they could mitigate their problem is break from their routine and find and discover spots on their own or ask fellow classmates or friends for ideas. Beyond the Library seeks to ensure that such a problem would not plague the University of Hawaii students, by creating an online platform for discovering, commenting and submitting their own spots. 

At the heart of it is community engagement, we want to make sure that all the information on a spot is easy and interesting to find. One aspect that pushes that notion is through the discover spots page, where the main idea is to hold a catalogue of all the spots the community has posted. The page contains pictures, a description and a section that lets students read and/or post their own comments about a specific spot.
